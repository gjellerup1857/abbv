# Adblock Plus

Welcome to the repository for the Adblock Plus extension!

The main project is hosted on [GitLab][abp-ext] and, in addition to the user
interface and the web extension code, the Adblock Plus extension also includes
[static filter lists][adblockinc-rules],
[eyeo's Web Extension Ad Blocking Toolkit (EWE)][eyeo-ewe] and
[eyeo's snippets][eyeo-snippets].

## About Adblock Plus

Adblock Plus is a free extension that allows users to customize their web
experience. Users can block annoying ads, disable tracking and lots more. Itâ€™s
available for all major desktop browsers and for mobile devices.

Adblock Plus is an open source project licensed under [GPLv3][gpl3] and subject
to its [Terms of Use][eyeo-terms]. [eyeo GmbH][eyeo] is the parent company of
Adblock Plus.

## Running scripts 

Please note that all scripts should be run from the root of the repository, not 
this host folder.

## Building

See the [readme at the root of the monorepo](../../README.md) for general
instructions on prerequisites, dependency management, how to build the
extensions.

### Building with secrets

Copy the `.env.defaults` file in the `host/adblockplus` directory to a `.env`
file and fill in the variables accordingly. This step can be skipped, and is
only required if you wish to enable the sending of telemetry.

### Bundling the UI

Various files need to be generated before using the UI. When building the UI
for inclusion in the extension, this is achieved using 
`npm run dist -w=host/adblockplus` from the root folder (not this host folder).

For usage [in the test environment](#testing), run the
[`build`](../../README.md#building-the-extensions-in-development-mode) script to
generate the various bundles for all [UI elements](#ui-elements).

Beyond that, this repository contains [various utilities][wiki-utils] that we
rely on across our development process.

### Error reporting

We use [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) to report the errors. In order to initialize it
during the build one has to pass `SENTRY_DSN` and `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`
variables in either `.env` file or as environment variable during the (CI) build. If not
initialized, console warning is shown. By default `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production`.
User emails are cut on client side and data scrubbing on
[server side](https://docs.sentry.io/security-legal-pii/scrubbing/server-side-scrubbing/) is
configured by default.

## UI elements

Specifications for Adblock Plus elements can be found in [eyeo's spec
repository][abp-spec].

### UI pages

These are pages that users primarily interact with because they are exposed to
them via the browser's UI.

- Bubble UI (popup)
- Developer tools panel (devtools-panel)
- Options
  - Desktop (desktop-options)
  - Mobile (Firefox) (mobile-options)

### Dialogs

These are pages that are dedicated to a specific feature and can be accessed via
UI pages.

- Filter composer (composer)
- Issue reporter (issue-reporter)

### Landing pages

These are pages that cannot be accessed via UI pages. They are either directly
or indirectly opened by the extension under certain conditions.

- Day 1 (day1)
- First run (first-run)
- Problem (problem)
- Updates (updates)

### Helper pages

These are pages that are part of another page. They are not meant to be shown on
their own.

- Bubble UI dummy (popup-dummy)
- Proxy (proxy)

### Additional extension functionality

These are parts of the extension logic which are running alongside the other
extension code in the extension's background process.

- Notifications
- Preferences

## Testing

If you don't want to build the entire extension, you can open UI pages in a test
environment using a local web server. This should be run from the root of the
monorepo.

```sh
npm run build:local
npm start --workspace host/adblockplus
```

After running `npm start --workspace host/adblockplus`, you can access the HTML 
pages under the URL shown in the terminal, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8080.

Various aspects of the pages can be tested by setting parameters in the URL (see
[list of URL parameters](docs/test-env.md#url-parameters)).

**Note**: You need to [create the bundles](#bundling-the-ui) for the UI page(s)
that you want to test.

### Unit testing

The `./test/unit` folder contains various mocha unit tests files
which can be run via `npm run $ test.unit.legacy --workspace host/adblockplus`. 
For `.ts` files we have jest unit tests that can be run via 
`npm run $ test.unit.standard --workspace host/adblockplus`. Those can be run 
together via `npm test -- --scope=adblockplus`.

### End-to-end testing

The `./test/end-to-end/tests` folder contains various end-to-end tests. These
tests can be executed locally, (in the latest stable Chrome, Firefox and Edge
browsers) or they can be executed using [LambdaTest](https://automation.lambdatest.com/).

#### Local run

To run the end-to-end tests locally:

```sh
npm run build:release -- --scope=adblockplus
npm run test:end-to-end -- --scope=adblockplus -- {chromium|edge|firefox} {2|3} [{all|filterlists|smoke}]
```

Note: Browser specified in the command is the browser that tests will be run on,
not the browser that we specify in build step.

The `FORCE_HEADFUL=true` environment variable may be used to run the browser in
headful mode instead of headless.

#### LambdaTest run

To run the end-to-end tests using [LambdaTest](https://automation.lambdatest.com/):

- Create a new .env.e2e file with your Lambda credentials. You can use the
[.env.e2e.defaults](./.env.e2e.defaults)
provided as a guide. The values in `.env.e2e.defaults` will be used as default
values, so you can choose to only copy the values you wish to override.
- Generate the [release builds](../../README.md#building-the-extensions-in-release-mode) 
of the extension.
- Additional steps are needed for running the tests with MV3 version of the extension:
  - Install the axios package globally: `npm install -g axios`
  - Upload the extension to LambdaTest by running (in this host folder): `export MV3_BUILD_CLOUD_URL=$(node test/end-to-end/upload-extension.js <LambdaTest username> <LambdaTest access key> dist/release/adblockplus-chrome-*-mv3.zip)`
- Run the test:end-to-end npm script 
`npm run --workspace host/adblockplus test:end-to-end-lambdatest-mv2 all` or
`npm run --workspace host/adblockplus test:end-to-end-lambdatest-mv3 all`.

#### Notes

- You can replace `all` tests with a specific test suite (`e2e`, `integration`,
`smoke`).
- If you only want to execute a single test file, you can replace the value of the
`all` property in [suites.js](./test/end-to-end/suites.js#L21)
to an array containing only the [path](./test/end-to-end/tests)
to the test(s) you want to run. Example:

  ```js
  all: ["./tests/test-options-page-dialog-links.js"],
  ```

- Allure reporter is used for displaying the results after the execution has been
completed. The report can be generated and opened using the
`npm run --workspace host/adblockplus test:generate-and-open-report` command.
- Screenshots of failing tests get saved to `./test/end-to-end/screenshots`

#### Docker run

These commands should be run from the repository root, not this host folder. 

Prerequisites: Docker

```sh
docker build -t end-to-end -f host/adblockplus/test/end-to-end/Dockerfile --build-arg MANIFEST_VERSION={2|3} --build-arg BROWSER={chromium|firefox|edge} --build-arg BUILD_EXTENSION={true|false} .
docker run --cpus=2 --shm-size=2g -it -e SUITE=smoke end-to-end
```

The default behaviour builds the extension inside the docker image. Setting the
`BUILD_EXTENSION` build argument to `false` will use the contents of the local
`dist` folder instead.

To access the screenshots for failing tests run the following command, which
copies them to the `host/adblockplus/test/end-to-end/screenshots` folder:

```shell
docker cp $(docker ps -aqf ancestor=end-to-end | head -n 1):/extensions/host/adblockplus/test/end-to-end/screenshots ./host/adblockplus/test/end-to-end
```

### Compliance tests

Compliance tests run on a local version of [testpages](https://abptestpages.org)
to assure compliance between Adblock Plus and other eyeo adblocking solutions.
They run the tests from the [testpages project](https://gitlab.com/eyeo/developer-experience/testpages.adblockplus.org/)
using a local build of the Adblock Plus extension.

Prerequisites:

- Docker

To run the tests:

```sh
EXTENSION=host/adblockplus/dist/release/<build file> MANIFEST={mv2|mv3} ./host/adblockplus/test/compliance.sh
```

Optional environment variables:

- BROWSER: Browser and version to run. The default is "chromium latest".
- IMAGE_NAME: Name of the docker container. The default is "compliance".

### Linting

You can lint all files via `npm run lint` or lint only specific file types:
- JavaScript/TypeScript: `npm run --workspace host/adblockplus $ lint.js`
- CSS: `npm run --workspace host/adblockplus $ lint.css`
- Translation files: `npm run --workspace host/adblockplus $ lint.locale`

**Note**: Both `eslint` and `stylelint` can help fix issues via `--fix` flag.
You can try the example below via [npx][npx] which should be automatically
included when you install `npm`.

`npx stylelint --fix css/real-file-name.css`

## CI pipeline

The project uses Gitlab CI to run pipelines which contain build and test jobs.

### Nightlies

Nightly builds for feature and release [branches][wiki-branches] can be found
as artifacts [from this page][abp-ext-nightlies].

### Runners

Pipeline jobs use self-managed runners from Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The
the setup of the runner is defined in [the devops runner project](https://gitlab.com/eyeo/devops/terraform/projects/gitlab-runners/terraform-adblock-inc-runner/), and the runner status can be checked
[here](https://gitlab.com/groups/adblockinc/ext/-/runners). Access to GCP
resources like the GCloud console can be granted by devops as well.
