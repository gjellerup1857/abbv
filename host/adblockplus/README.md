# Adblock Plus

Welcome to the repository for the Adblock Plus extension!

The main project is hosted on [GitLab][abp-ext] and, in addition to the user
interface and the web extension code, the Adblock Plus extension also includes
[static filter lists][adblockinc-rules],
[eyeo's Web Extension Ad Blocking Toolkit (EWE)][eyeo-ewe] and
[eyeo's snippets][eyeo-snippets].

## About Adblock Plus

Adblock Plus is a free extension that allows users to customize their web
experience. Users can block annoying ads, disable tracking and lots more. Itâ€™s
available for all major desktop browsers and for mobile devices.

Adblock Plus is an open source project licensed under [GPLv3][gpl3] and subject
to its [Terms of Use][eyeo-terms]. [eyeo GmbH][eyeo] is the parent company of
Adblock Plus.

## Running scripts

Please note that all scripts should be run from the root of the repository, not
this host folder.

## Building

See the [readme at the root of the monorepo](../../README.md) for general
instructions on prerequisites, dependency management, how to build the
extensions.

### Building with secrets

Copy the `.env.defaults` file in the `host/adblockplus` directory to a `.env`
file and fill in the variables accordingly. This step can be skipped, and is
only required if you wish to enable the sending of telemetry.

### Bundling the UI

Various files need to be generated before using the UI. When building the UI
for inclusion in the extension, this is achieved using
`npm run dist -w=host/adblockplus` from the root folder (not this host folder).

For usage [in the test environment](#testing), run the
[`build`](../../README.md#building-the-extensions-in-development-mode) script to
generate the various bundles for all [UI elements](#ui-elements).

Beyond that, this repository contains [various utilities][wiki-utils] that we
rely on across our development process.

### Error reporting

We use [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) to report the errors. In order to initialize it
during the build one has to pass `SENTRY_DSN` and `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT`
variables in either `.env` file or as environment variable during the (CI) build. If not
initialized, console warning is shown. By default `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=production`.
User emails are cut on client side and data scrubbing on
[server side](https://docs.sentry.io/security-legal-pii/scrubbing/server-side-scrubbing/) is
configured by default.

## UI elements

Specifications for Adblock Plus elements can be found in [eyeo's spec
repository][abp-spec].

### UI pages

These are pages that users primarily interact with because they are exposed to
them via the browser's UI.

- Bubble UI (popup)
- Developer tools panel (devtools-panel)
- Options
  - Desktop (desktop-options)
  - Mobile (Firefox) (mobile-options)

### Dialogs

These are pages that are dedicated to a specific feature and can be accessed via
UI pages.

- Filter composer (composer)
- Issue reporter (issue-reporter)

### Landing pages

These are pages that cannot be accessed via UI pages. They are either directly
or indirectly opened by the extension under certain conditions.

- Day 1 (day1)
- First run (first-run)
- Problem (problem)
- Updates (updates)

### Helper pages

These are pages that are part of another page. They are not meant to be shown on
their own.

- Bubble UI dummy (popup-dummy)
- Proxy (proxy)

### Additional extension functionality

These are parts of the extension logic which are running alongside the other
extension code in the extension's background process.

- Notifications
- Preferences

## Testing

If you don't want to build the entire extension, you can open UI pages in a test
environment using a local web server. This should be run from the root of the
monorepo.

```sh
npm run build:local
npm start --workspace host/adblockplus
```

After running `npm start --workspace host/adblockplus`, you can access the HTML
pages under the URL shown in the terminal, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8080.

Various aspects of the pages can be tested by setting parameters in the URL (see
[list of URL parameters](docs/test-env.md#url-parameters)).

**Note**: You need to [create the bundles](#bundling-the-ui) for the UI page(s)
that you want to test.

### Unit testing

The `./test/unit` folder contains various mocha unit tests files
which can be run via `npm run $ test.unit.legacy --workspace host/adblockplus`.
For `.ts` files we have jest unit tests that can be run via
`npm run $ test.unit.love --workspace host/adblockplus`. Those can be run
together via `npm test -- --scope=adblockplus`.

### End-to-end tests

End-to-end tests load the release build of the Adblock Plus extension in the
browser to run the end to end test suites.

Notes:

- Release builds are needed for both local and Docker runs. The commands for
  that are added to the examples.
- Commands given below should be run from the root directory of this
  repository, the same as the build commands.
- The browser specified in the command is the browser that tests will be run
  on, not the browser that we specify in build step.
- DNS mapping from `testpages.adblockplus.org` to `127.0.0.1` is used in
  browsers in order to test with locally served pages and AA-related filter
  rules.

#### Local run

To run the end-to-end tests locally:

```sh
npm run build:release -- --scope=adblockplus
npm run test:end-to-end -- --scope=adblockplus -- {chromium|edge|firefox} {2|3} [{all|filterlists|smoke}]
```

By default browsers run headless. Setting the environment variable
`FORCE_HEADFUL=true` will trigger a headful run instead.

By default webDriverIO in Firefox is opening every tab or window as a new tab.
More details can be found in this
[link](https://gitlab.com/eyeo/extensions/extensions/-/merge_requests/206).

If you only want to execute a single test file, you can replace the values of
properties in [suites.js](./test/end-to-end/suites.js) to an array containing
only the [path](./test/end-to-end/tests) to the test(s) you want to run.
Example:

```js
all: ["./tests/test-options-page-dialog-links.js"],
```

Screenshots for failing tests are stored in `host/adblockplus/test/end-to-end/screenshots`.

#### Docker run

Prerequisites: Docker

```sh
npm run build:release -- --scope=adblockplus
docker build -t end-to-end -f host/adblockplus/test/end-to-end/Dockerfile .
docker run --cpus=2 --shm-size=2g -it -e BROWSER={chromium|firefox|edge} -e MANIFEST_VERSION={2|3} -e SUITE={all|filterlists|smoke} end-to-end
```

To access the screenshots for failing tests run the following command, which
copies them to the `host/adblockplus/test/end-to-end/screenshots` folder:

```shell
docker cp $(docker ps -aqf ancestor=end-to-end | head -n 1):/extensions/host/adblockplus/test/end-to-end/screenshots ./host/adblockplus/test/end-to-end
```

### Compliance tests

Compliance tests run on a local version of [testpages](https://abptestpages.org)
to assure compliance between Adblock Plus and other eyeo adblocking solutions.
They run the tests from the [testpages project](https://gitlab.com/eyeo/developer-experience/testpages.adblockplus.org/)
using a local build of the Adblock Plus extension.

Prerequisites:

- Docker

To run the tests:

```sh
EXTENSION=host/adblockplus/dist/release/<build file> MANIFEST={mv2|mv3} ./host/adblockplus/test/compliance.sh
```

Optional environment variables:

- BROWSER: Browser and version to run. The default is "chromium latest".
- IMAGE_NAME: Name of the docker container. The default is "compliance".

### Linting

You can lint all files via `npm run lint` or lint only specific file types:

- JavaScript/TypeScript: `npm run --workspace host/adblockplus $ lint.js`
- Translation files: `npm run --workspace host/adblockplus $ lint.locale`
- Other files: `npm run --workspace host/adblockplus $ lint.prettier`

The following can help fix issues:

- JavaScript/TypeScript: `npx eslint --fix <file path>`
- Other files: `npm run prettier-fix`

## CI pipeline

The project uses Gitlab CI to run pipelines which contain build and test jobs.

### Nightlies

Nightly builds for feature and release [branches][wiki-branches] can be found
as artifacts [from this page][abp-ext-nightlies].

### Runners

Pipeline jobs use self-managed runners from Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The
the setup of the runner is defined in [the devops runner project](https://gitlab.com/eyeo/devops/terraform/projects/gitlab-runners/terraform-adblock-inc-runner/), and the runner status can be checked
[here](https://gitlab.com/groups/adblockinc/ext/-/runners). Access to GCP
resources like the GCloud console can be granted by devops as well.

## Uploading sourcemaps

The gitlab CI configuration has `release` stage and `upload_sourcemaps` job
which is runs for tags like `adblockplus-v<number>` and uploads the releases sourcemaps to Sentry.
It requires `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` global variable configured for the project.
To do the same manually on the command line one has to:

1. Login to Sentry with `npm run sentry:login` and provide Sentry auth token.
2. Create a release with `VERSION=<version> npm run sentry:release-new`
3. Prepare unzipped file:

```
mkdir ./dist/release/sourcemaps-mv3
&& unzip dist/release/adblockplus-*mv3.zip '*.js.map' -d ./dist/release/sourcemaps-mv3
```

4. Upload the sourcemaps with `VERSION=<version> npm run sentry:sourcemaps`.
   The sourcemaps are overwritten.
5. Finalize the release with `VERSION=<version> npm run sentry:release-finalize`
