# What is the Scratchpad?

While in the end, all components must be documented using Storybook, sometimes it can be easier to get up and running running or test things out in a simpler situation. 

The scratchpad directory is set up to make this possible. Copy `scratchpad-example` into a directory called just `scratchpad` and then, running 

```bash
npm run dev
```

will start a server showing code from `scratchpad/App.js`.

This directory is ignored by git, so you do not have to worry about posting work back accidentally.
